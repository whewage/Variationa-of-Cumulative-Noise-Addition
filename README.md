# Variationa-of-Cumulative-Noise-Addition
Cumulative Noise Addition is the state of the art of noise addition methods to preserve the privacy of data while maintaining a good level of accuracy. When this method is applied to a data stream there can be a drastic drop of accuracy with the time because of the huge amount of noise added to the stream. We experimented seven different variations of cumulative noise addition by in-cooperating different techniques to control the noise level. The coding was done using Clojure and needs to be run via Jupyter notebook.
